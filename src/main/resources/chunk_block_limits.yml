# Block Limits Configuration
# ============================================
# This module limits how many blocks of each type
# can be placed within a radius to improve server performance.
#
# NOTE: Existing blocks that exceed limits will NOT be removed.
# The limit only applies when placing NEW blocks.
# ============================================

enabled: true

# Radius in blocks to check for blocks (same as entity limiter)
radius: 56

# Worlds where this limiter is active
worlds:
  - world
  - world_nether
  - world_the_end

# Message sent when player tries to place a block over the limit
# Placeholders: {block}, {limit}, {current}, {radius}
deny-message: "&cYou cannot place more {block} in this area! &7(Limit: {limit})"

# ============================================
# RADIUS LIMITS
# ============================================
# Maximum blocks of each type within the radius
# Set to -1 to disable limit for that block type
#
# You can use:
# 1. Predefined categories (groups multiple blocks):
#    - "hoppers", "pistons", "furnaces", "shulker-boxes", etc.
#
# 2. Direct material names (for specific blocks):
#    - "TNT", "SPAWNER", "JUKEBOX", "NOTE_BLOCK", etc.
#    - Use exact Minecraft material names (uppercase with underscores)
#    - List: https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/Material.html
